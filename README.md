# UniversityWebApp
A school web app written in C# with the .Net framework, probably some front end framework thrown in eventually. Maybe Angular. Or React. Whichever I feel like in the moment. Will demonstrate CRUD functionality, use a SQL database (through docker on my local machine), probably throw some authorization in depending on how quickly i need to turn this around.
